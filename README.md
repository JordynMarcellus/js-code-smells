# Javascript Code Smells

## Table of Contents
### Introduction
*In computer programming, code smell is any symptom in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. According to Fowler, "a code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system"* - [Code Smell - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell)

Bottom line, we need to refactor code with smells to make it more maintainable and reduce the number of bugs it introduces.
